# BitTorrent Client (WIP) 📡

A BitTorrent client built from scratch using Python — no external libraries or wrappers.  
This project focuses on learning and implementing the **BitTorrent protocol**, **peer communication**, and **multi-threaded downloads**.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Python 3
- HTTP & UDP Protocols
- Multithreading
- Socket Programming
- RichConsole (CLI interface)

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Parses `.torrent` files (multi-file support)
- ✅ Communicates with trackers using **UDP and HTTP**
- ✅ Peer connection and piece request logic
- ✅ CLI interface for feedback and control
- ⚠️ Currently undergoing major refactor and improvements


## 💡 Why I Built This

Most students avoid low-level networking.  
I wanted to challenge myself by implementing the BitTorrent protocol and handling sockets, threading, and real protocol communication directly — no shortcuts.

This is a deep dive into how peer-to-peer systems work behind the scenes.

## 📌 Future Goals

- ⏳ Rewrite peer handling logic for scalability
- 🧠 Optimize download queue and piece selection
- 💬 Improve error handling and robustness
- 🖥️ Optional GUI or dashboard (stretch goal)
